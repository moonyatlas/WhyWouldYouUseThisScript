# I AM GONNA REWRITE THIS IN PYTHON
## WHY? Because my current code sucks and C is just hard to work in, i am a simple man so ill just use python.



### WhyWouldYouUseThisScript
Small Compiler for a bad "Programming Language"
Either change the example.why file to use it or change the path directly in the source code

Its just a more complicated calculator for now...
